# Purified-Rain
On Bilibili, I am credited as Louisa the Purified Rain. I picked Louisa because she was the highest leveled purple marble in MK series. Then, I got the inspiration from Arknights, where Whisperain appears similar to Louisa according to a fan art. Furthermore, I want myself to stay away from pollutions, mostly bad habits in studying.
